    "text": "In the United States, it is often preached how it is the “Land of Opportunity” and that work ethic will equal your output, usually through income and earnings. However, there is still systemic oppression present that can prevent this ideal from occurring.\nAs a woman, I have grown up around stereotypes and appropriation surrounding my gender. The history of equal rights for women is very recent, with legislature such as the 19th Amendment and Title IX both being very necessary in their nature yet contemporary ideas in our society. Because of the only recent historical landmarks in women’s history, various aspects of our lives are still affected by systemic sexism. One of the most apparent results of this oppression is the gender wage gap, in which it is theorized how a male would have a higher paycheck than his female counterpart despite having the exact qualifications and characteristics.\nI will be researching how the gender wage gap still affects women in the 21st century, asserting how much work is to be done for economic equity between the sexes. I will be using data from United States Census Bureau with data for each year between the 1960s and 2017, highlighting the pivotal years in which significant change was passed legislatively."

The grain of the data is course as each data point is either a percentage of distribution for household earnings or an annual mean or median income. There are 383 rows and 16 columns.

I extracted a data set within this data set that categorizes the amount of households in each income bracket regardless of race or Hispanic origin in addition to median income, with 51 rows and 16 columns. I decided to include this data set as I am focusing on the inequities based on gender rather than other factors such as race and Hispanic origin.

I chose to use the position “dodge” to place the column values for each sex for each year adjacent to each other so that the discrepancies between values can be depicted. Additionally, since there were many values for the “Year” x-axis, I decided the scale the x-axis to sequence the values from 1967 to 2017 by counts of 5.\nIn the bar chart, it can be concluded that while both male and female total workers have increased over time, the total amount of male workers has always been visibly greater than total amount of female workers. However, it should be noted that the distance between the values of total male vs female workers has appeared to shrink slightly over time, and has held this distance.\n\n\nShow code\nggplot(totals) +\n  geom_col(\n    mapping = aes(\n      x    = Year, \n      y    = total,\n      fill = sex\n    ), \n    position = \"dodge\"\n  ) + \n  labs(\n    title    = \"Total Male vs Female Workers, 1967-2017\",\n    x        = \"Year\",\n    y        = \"Total Workers\",\n    fill    = \"Sex\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(1967, 2017, 5), \n    lim    = c(1967, 2017)\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(\n      angle = 45, \n      hjust = 1\n      )\n) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Sex\",labels=c(\"Female\", \"Male\"),values=c(\"darkred\", \"darkblue\"))\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_col()`)."

I will do this by transforming my column-wise data for household income brackets to row-wise data, so I can have percentage values for each year for each income bracket.\n\n\nShow code\nfinalCleanData2 &lt;- cleanData2 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"&lt;15000\" : \"&gt;200000\"), \n    names_to  = \"income_bracket\", \n    values_to = \"percentage\"\n    ) |&gt;\n   filter(!is.na(percentage)) |&gt;\n   select(Year, income_bracket, percentage)\n\nfinalCleanData2\n\n\n# A tibble: 459 × 3\n    Year income_bracket percentage\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2017 &lt;15000               10.7\n 2  2017 15000_24999           9.6\n 3  2017 25000_34999           9.2\n 4  2017 35000_49999          12.3\n 5  2017 50000_74999          16.5\n 6  2017 75000_99999          12.5\n 7  2017 100000_149999        14.5\n 8  2017 150000_199999         7  \n 9  2017 &gt;200000               7.7\n10  2016 &lt;15000               11  \n# ℹ 449 more rows"

    "text": "Plotting Percentage of Households in Each Income Bracket Over Time\nNow, I want to visualize where each income bracket trends over time from 1967 to 2017, and determine if any equalization occurs (lines generally trending towards the same “middle-ground” line). To achieve this, I utilized a scatterplot with “Year” on the x-axis, percentage of households on the y-axis, and the various income brackets as colors to categorized. I also included a line of best fit for each income bracket as it changes over time to better visualize each income brackets’ trend from 1967 to 2017. I noticed that most income brackets were around the “middle-ground” of the data set, generally experiencing little change from around their area. However, the highest initial percentage income bracket of 50,000-74,999 experienced the greatest decrease, while the two lowest initial percentage income brackets of 150,000-199,000 and 200,000 and greater experienced the greatest increase. The relative trend of all income brackets over this time generally trending toward the “middle-ground” of the data implies that household income equity is becoming greater than it was in 1967 and is on trend to continue becoming more equitable.\n\n\nShow code\nfinalCleanData2 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(income_bracket) & !is.na(percentage)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    income_bracket = factor(income_bracket, levels = c(\n      \"&lt;15000\",\"15000_24999\",\"25000_34999\",\n      \"35000_49999\",\"50000_74999\",\"75000_99999\",\n      \"100000_149999\",\"150000_199999\",\"&gt;200000\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x     = Year, \n      y     = percentage, \n      color = income_bracket\n      )\n    ) +\n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Household Earning Range by Percentage, 1967-2017\",\n    x     = \"Year\",\n    y     = \"Percentage\",\n    color = \"Household Earning Range\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(1967, 2017, 5), \n    lim    = c(1967, 2017)\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(\n      angle = 45, \n      hjust = 1\n      ) \n) +\n  scale_color_manual(name=\"Household Earning Range\",labels=c(\"&lt;$15000\", \"$15000-24999\",\"$25000-34999\", \"$35000-49999\",\"$50000-74999\",\"$75000-99999\",\"$100000-149999\",\"$150000-199999\",\"&gt;$200000\"),values=c(\"salmon\",\"orange\",\"yellow\",\"lightgreen\",\"cyan\",\"blue\",\"darkblue\",\"purple\",\"pink\"))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 8 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`)."

    "text": "Gender Inequity and the Gender Wage Gap\nThroughout my findings, I have determined that there is a literal gap between the number of male and female workers and the ratio of full-time to total workers for female and male workers, in respect to the line and scatter plot graphs visualizing the trend of these two variables over time. These gaps in workforce participation and full-time workers contribute to the overall wage gap experienced by females. However, it is important to acknowledge the headway that has been made in closing these gaps, as visualized by the increase in slope of all lines pertaining to variables regarding women in comparison to men. Title IX was a significant stride in the right direction in 1973, paving the way for other legislation to follow that would continue this progress. As we strive closer to true equity between the genders in regards to socioeconomic opportunities and status as represented by workforce participation and full-time participation, we will begin to notice all-around equity as income bracket percentages deviate less from each other."

The gaps are very much present within all my visualizations between male and female variables. Therefore, we must continue to push for effective legislation and execution of orders that will continue to augment women until we are matched with our male counterparts with socioeconomic potential. I would recommend that agencies related to Title IX and equity be continuously held to high standards, and be held accountable by federal and state institutions."

    "text": "Limitations\nLimitations to our data could result from the fact that the U.S. Census Bureau can only take data from “civilian non-institutional population of the United States living in housing units and members of the Armed Forces living in civilian housing units on a military base or in a household not on a military base”. Even though this data set contains data from a wide range of groups, there still may be groups of data within the United States that would be crucial to include in the data as well that the Census Bureau did not account for. Additionally, only drawing from data in the United States discounts how much progress women make in other countries, as many other countries such as those in the Scandinavian Region have made incredible progress in gender equity, and should be acknowledged."
