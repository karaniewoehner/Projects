## Hi, I’m Kara 👋
I’m a student-athlete at **Davidson College** studying **Mathematics and Data Science** with a strong interest in applying quantitative methods to real-world problems.

My work focuses on **data analysis, visualization, and applied machine learning**, particularly in areas related to **economic equity and sports analytics**.

I'm driven by the possibility of joining the advancement of women in male-dominated fields that used to suppress our presence, such as STEM fields, sports, and leadership, and discovering how my own experience can be leveraged to elevate other women to their goals.
