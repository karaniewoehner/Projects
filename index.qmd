Hello! I'm Kara and I'm currently a student-athlete at Davidson College studying Mathematics and Data Science. I have discovered a love of working with numbers and problem-solving through code, and my esteemed projects will be located on this page!

As a woman in STEM and in collegiate sport, I want other girls and women to be uplifted and encouraged to follow their passions and dreams, no matter the social barriers. With this, I have been able to find an intersection between my interest in problem-solving and quantitative reasoning with my passion for the empowerment of women. I have had the opportunity to research, refine, and visualize the data surrounding the gender wage gap and the progress that various legislative actions had made on gender equity. This project, "Gender Inequities through an Economic Lens", was created with R in Jupyter Notebook.
